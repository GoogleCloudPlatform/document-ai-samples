# DocAI Dev
This is an as-is sample of a React application that imports the JSON output of Document AI processing and shows
to the user a more consumable representation of the JSON.

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kolban-google/docai-dev) contains the source code of the project.  A deployed version can be found [here](https://kolban-google.github.io/docai-dev/).

When opened, open a JSON file that was generated by Document AI can be loaded by clicking the `LOAD JSON` button.  A dialog will appear
providing you the opportunity to load a local file.

You can then navigate between a set of tabs:

The Document tab shows a visual representation of the document that was processed.  You can see the entities contained. For each entity, you
can click on an information button and see the details of the JSON of that entity.

The JSON tab shows you the JSON of the document.

The Details tab shows the complete details of the processing in terms of statistics.
