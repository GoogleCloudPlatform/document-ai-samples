# Sorting post-HITL Documents by language

This project uses the languages detected by Document AI (post-HITL) to sort the `Document.json` files into separate Cloud Storage buckets.
The document files are sorted by the most frequent language in the document, if there are multiple detected.

## Running the sample

1. Install the prerequisites: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

1. Update the following values with information from your project

   ```python
   PROJECT_ID = "YOUR PROJECT ID"

   # Output Files from Human-in-the-loop
   GCS_HITL_BUCKET = "input-bucket"
   GCS_HITL_PREFIX = "input-directory"

   # Output Bucket names will be in the format of GCS_OUTPUT_BUCKET_PREFIX + language
   GCS_OUTPUT_BUCKET_PREFIX = "output-bucket-"
   ```

1. Run the sample: `python main.py`
