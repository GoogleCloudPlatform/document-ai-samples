## Adding a new sample

### Policies

Samples in this repository are expected to:

- Adhere to best practices
- Be up to date
- Demonstrate a clear Document AI use-case or integration
- Have a clear focus and goal
- Have owners that respond to issues and questions
- Pass tests (if present)

Samples repeatedly failing to meet this criteria will be moved or removed.

The purpose of these expectations are to ensure quality, up to date code for
others. If you need help keeping your sample in line with these expectations
please reach out to the `@GoogleCloudPlatform/ml-apis`.

### How to add a new sample

If you would like to add a new sample to this repository please follow these
instructions. If your sample is large, complex, or you would like feedback
before adding a sample to this repository please open a issue with your question or
request and assign it to `@GoogleCloudPlatform/ml-apis`

1. Determine the name for your sample.

   Generally the name of your sample should be a few words that briefly
   describe, the purpose or function of your sample code. For example:
   `pdf-splitter-python`. Here are a few guidelines:

   - Do not include `Document AI`, `documentai`, `document-ai` or `docai` in
     the name of your sample
   - The name of your sample must be hyphenated and only contain letters,
     numbers, and hyphens.
   - If the sample is primarily one language the name for your sample must
     end in `-language-name` e.g. `-nodejs`, `-python`, etc.

1. Create a new folder in the root of the repository or in the community folders

   To add a new samples to this repository you must add a new folder to either the
   root of the repository or in the `community` folder. The name of the folder must
   correspond to the name of your sample.

1. Create a README.md for your sample

   Each sample must have its own README.md file in the root of the sample
   folder. This sample must include:

   - The name of the sample
   - A description of what the sample does
   - Detailed instructions on how to setup and run the sample
   - [Community samples only] Add the following disclaimer to your sample's
     README.md file:

     ```text
     ## Disclaimer
     This community sample is not officially maintained by Google.
     ```

   - Detail instructions on how to run tests (if present)

1. Update the repository's README with a link to your sample

   Edit the repository's README.md file to with the name of your sample, a link to
   the sample repository and a brief description. If your sample is in the
   `community` folder add your sample's name, link and description to the
   "Community" section of the repository's README.md.

1. Format and lint your code

   This repository uses a tool from GitHub called [super-linter](https://GitHub.com/GitHub/super-linter) that
   formats and lints code in multiple languages. This helps ensure consistency and prevents common issues.

   For Python, use [black](https://GitHub.com/psf/black) to format your code.
   Linting checks with flake8, isort, pylint, and mypy will also be performed.

1. [non-community samples only] Setup testing and GitHub Actions

   This step is not required for samples located in the `community` folder. All
   samples in the root of the repository must have tests and those tests must be
   setup to run on new pull requests that edit files in your sample folder.

   1. Create a GitHub Actions YAML configuration file for your sample To add
      enable testing for your sample create a new YAML file in the
      `.GitHub/workflows` folder of this repository with the name of your sample
      with the `.yaml` file extension. For example:
      `.GitHub/workflows/pdf-splitter-python.yaml`

   1. Configure when your tests run

      Use GitHub Action's triggers to run your tests on a pull request for the
      `main` branch and use `path` config to scope your tests to run only on
      pull requests that change your sample's code. For example:

      ```yaml
      name: PDF Splitter Python Sample
      on:
        push:
          branches:
            - main
          paths:
            - "pdf-splitter-python/**"
      ```

      See
      [GitHub's Actions trigger documentation](https://docs.GitHub.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow)
      for more information.

   1. Connect your tests to GitHub Actions Use GitHub Actions' `jobs` feature
      to define a test environment and run your tests. For example:

      ```yaml
      ---
      jobs:
        unit:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          defaults:
            run:
              working-directory: ./pdf-splitter-python
          strategy:
            matrix:
              python: ["3.7", "3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]
          steps:
            - name: Checkout
              uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - name: Setup Python
              uses: actions/setup-python@v3
              with:
                python-version: ${{ matrix.python }}
            - name: Install requirements.txt
              run: |
                python -m pip install --upgrade pip
                pip install -r requirements.txt
            - name: Install pylint
              run: |
                python -m pip install --upgrade pip
                pip install pylint
            - name: Analyze code with pylint
              run: |
                pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
            - name: Run unit tests
              run: |
                python main_test.py
      ```

      See
      [GitHub's Actions job documentation](https://docs.GitHub.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow)
      for more information.

1. Add a code owners entry for your sample

   Add an entry in the `.GitHub/CODEOWNERS` file (`community/CODEOWNERS` for
   community samples) for your sample folder and add the GitHub usernames of
   the owners. Please include a comment indicating the owner of the sample. For
   example:

   ```text
   # @matthewayne is the default owner for PDF splitter sample changes
   /pdf-splitter-python/ @matthewayne
   ```

1. Start a review for your sample

   1. Before submitting for review, create your Pull Request as a draft so that the linter can run before alerting reviewers.

   [Create a pull request](https://docs.GitHub.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
   and add
   [@GoogleCloudPlatform/ml-apis](https://GitHub.com/orgs/GoogleCloudPlatform/teams/ml-apis)
   as a reviewer

### Code Quality Checks

All code samples in this project are checked for formatting and style, to ensure a consistent experience.
To test prior to submitting a pull request, you can follow these steps for Python.

From a command-line terminal, install the code analysis tools:

```shell
pip3 install --user -U black black[jupyter] flake8 isort pyupgrade
```

You'll likely need to add the directory where these were installed to your PATH:

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then, set an environment variable for your code file (or directory):

```shell
export sample="your-code.py"
```

Finally, run this code block to check for errors. Each step will attempt to
automatically fix any issues. If the fixes can't be performed automatically,
then you will need to manually address them before submitting your PR.

```shell
black "$sample" --line-length=88
pyupgrade "$sample"
isort "$sample" --profile google
nbqa isort "$sample" --profile google
flake8 "$sample" --extend-ignore=W391,E501,F821,E402,F404,W503,E203,E722,W293,W291
```
