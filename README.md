## Overview

The repository contains samples and [Community Samples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/document-ai-samples/tree/main/community) that demonstrate how to analyze, classify and search documents using Google Cloud Document AI.

## Samples

* [Apps Script & Google Drive Integration](apps-script-google-drive): Code in Google [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) for integration with Document AI.
* [Document AI Warehouse Processing (Python)](document_ai_warehouse/document_ai_warehouse_processing_python/): This project demonstrates how to perform common actions on Document AI Warehouse through API.
* [BQ Connector](bq-connector/): This project uses the Document AI API to process a document, format the result and save it into a BigQuery table.
* [Content Moderation with Dialogflow CX](cx-content-moderation): This project uses the Content Moderation processor with Dialogflow CX for toxicity routing during a conversation.
* [Filter HITL Language](filter-hitl-language/): This project uses the languages detected by Document AI (post-HITL) to sort the `Document.json` files into separate Cloud Storage buckets.
* [Fraud Detection](fraud-detection-python/): This project uses the Document AI Invoice Parser with EKG and Google Maps to store document Entities in BigQuery.
* [JSON Explorer](document-json-explorer/): A React Tool to explore the Document JSON Response.
* [Language Extraction](extract-languages/): This project uses the Document AI API to detect the languages in a multi-page document.
* [Paper Summarization](paper_summarization/): This project uses the Document AI API to summarize scientific articles.
* [PDF Embedded Text](pdf-embedded-text/): Demonstrates how to use the Native PDF parsing feature for the OCR Processor (`v1beta3`)
* [SQL over Docs](sql-pdf-python/): This project shows how to run a BigQuery SQL and extract information from documents.
* [Tax Processing Pipeline](tax-processing-pipeline-python/): This project uses the Document AI API to classify, parse, and calculate a tax form using multiple document types.
* [Web App Demo](web-app-demo/): This project is a full-stack application that uses Document AI to process different types of documents. This application currently supports Form, Invoice and OCR processors.

### Samples not in this Repository

* [Document AI Intake Accelerator](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/document-intake-accelerator)

### Deprecated Samples

Replaced by [Document AI Toolbox](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/samples/documentai-toolbox-quickstart)

* [PDF Splitter](pdf-splitter-python/): This project uses the Document AI API to split PDF documents.
* [Tabular Data Extraction](extract-tables/): This project uses the Document AI API to extract tabular data from a document.

### Test Document Files

If you need Document Files to run the samples, you can access them from this publicly-accessible [Google Cloud Storage Bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/downloading-objects).

`gs://cloud-samples-data/documentai/`

You can also view sample input/output files by processor on the [Sample Output](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/output) page of the documentation.
