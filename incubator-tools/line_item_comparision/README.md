* **parsed_jsons_URI** : It is GCS path which contains document-processed JSON results
* **post_processed_jsons_URI** : It is GCS path which contains document-processed JSON results

## Output Details
Upon successfull execution of code, you can able to see three generated CSV files(`GT_line.csv`, `post_line.csv` 7 `compare_all.csv`). Please refer those csv files for better-understanding.
