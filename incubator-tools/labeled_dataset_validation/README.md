## Output Details
The output is in 2 CSV files and a dictionary.

In the CSV files , the columns are as below  
**File_Name**: File name of the labeled json in GCP folder  
**Blank_Entities**: The entities which are labeled blank or which doesn't have anything in the mentionText of the entity  
**Yes**- Denotes there are Blank entities  
**No** - No Blank entities found in the json  

### Labeling issues

The entities which have issues in Text anchors or Page anchors are treated as labeling issues because of which you cannot convert into proto format.

### 2. labeling_issues_with_entity_type.csv
This CSV file is the same as **labeling_issues.csv** but with a list of entity types which have issues.  

For Blank_entities and Labeling issues, the entity type needs to be provided in a list which have issues  

But for overlapping issues , it gives the entity name in the nested list where each list has 2 values which are labeled in the same area.
