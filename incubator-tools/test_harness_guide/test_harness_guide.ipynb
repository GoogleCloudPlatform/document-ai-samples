    "\n",
    "Here “A:entity_name” represents the name of the entities present in both input and output json files. “B: initial_prediction” represents the data associated with the entity in file 1 (i.e json file generated using docAI API) similarly in “C:current_prediction” represents the data associated with corresponding entity in file 2 (i.e previously accepted result json file), “D:match”  shows boolean values (i.e True of False) where True means the the value is exactly same as it was in the previously accepted result and false means there is some mismatch between the data in entity. Last “E:fuzzy ratio” gives a number between 0 to 1 which tells that if an entity was present in both of the files but still there is some difference in data then how much that difference is. Column “E” also shows three possible colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The color coding is defined to show the clear difference between two schemas:  \n",
    "* Green→<img src=\"./images/green.png\" width=20 height=7> </img>→ Entity matches in both files more than 75%.\n",
    "* Yellow→<img src=\"./images/yellow.png\" width=20 height=7> </img>→Entity matches in both files from 51% to 75%.\n",
    "* Pink→<img src=\"./images/pink.png\" width=20 height=7> </img>→Entity matching percentage is below 51%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next worksheet “All Entities” is the report of total entities of various types out of which how many were not captured and how many were captured but with a slight change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last worksheet is “Error Entities”  which contains a list of all entities which have some issues and what is wrong with it. It has five columns representing “ input file name”, “ name of entity”, “ value in file 1”, “ value in file 2” and “matching score”. In the last column  color coding is also there as we’ve used above.\n",
