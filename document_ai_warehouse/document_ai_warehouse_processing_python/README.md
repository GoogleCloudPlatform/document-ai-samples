# Using Document AI Warehouse Python Client Library to run common operations on Document AI Warehouse

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform common actions on Document AI Warehouse through the API. `dw_processing.ipynb` uses `DocumentWarehouseUtils.py` for abstraction and readability.
It is recommended to look at the code provided in the utils python files.

1. Create document & folder Schema.
2. Create a folder using schema created in step #1.
3. Create a document using schema created in step #1 using inline raw document & set property values.
4. Create a document using schema created in step #1 using document stored in gcs & embed DocumentAI processor output alongwith.
5. Link document created in step #4 to the folder
6. Search document
7. Clean-up

## Prerequisites

1. Please ensure that you have a Document AI Warehouse instance in your project. You can follow this [quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/document-warehouse/docs/quickstart) to complete the setup.
2. Create a Document AI [Invoice processor](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/processors-list#processor_invoice-processor) and update the `DOCAI_PROCESSOR_ID` variable below.
3. If you are using a Vertex AI Workbench Managed Notebook, ensure to grant the following roles:

- [`roles/contentwarehouse.documentAdmin`](https://cloud.google.com/document-warehouse/docs/manage-access-control)
- [`roles/documentai.apiUser`](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/access-control/iam-roles)

If you are using your own dev environment please ensure to grant the specified permissions to the identity.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt
